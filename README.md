# FindMyPhone

FindMyPhone is a simple Android application that allows a user to locate his/her phone, even when it is on the silent profile. This can be done by using the SMS feature or calls. On download, the user is provided with the option of setting a password to prevent unauthorized use of the application. He/she can also set a command which is can be sent in a text message by someone else, in order to locate the missing phone. A correct command will result in the phone ringing. 
There are also the option of maintain two lists – an emergency contact list and a black list. A user can add a contact to the emergency contact list to enable this person to help locate the phone at any time by calling, whether it is on silent profile or not. On the other hand, to black list a contact would mean that even with the right command, the person will not be able to make the user’s phone ring.
